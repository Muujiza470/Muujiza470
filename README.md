# Preciosa Muujiza Ngoy Kalumba

I am a graduate student in Artificial Intelligence & Business Analytics at the University of South Florida. My work focuses on building structured, data-driven solutions that combine statistical modeling, machine learning, and database design.

I’m particularly interested in how analytics systems are designed end-to-end — from relational database architecture to predictive modeling and business interpretation.
